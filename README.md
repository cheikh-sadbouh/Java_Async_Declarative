# Java CompletableFuture for Asynchronous Programming

## Introduction
Java provides powerful features for asynchronous programming, allowing developers to write concurrent and non-blocking code. One of the key classes for working with asynchronous operations is `CompletableFuture`. `CompletableFuture` is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package and provides a convenient way to perform asynchronous computations and handle their results.

This README aims to provide an overview of how Java supports asynchronous programming using `CompletableFuture`, highlighting its features and demonstrating common usage patterns.

## Features and Benefits
- **Asynchronous Execution**: `CompletableFuture` allows you to perform computations asynchronously, leveraging the benefits of parallelism and non-blocking operations.
- **Composition**: You can chain multiple `CompletableFuture` instances together, allowing you to express complex asynchronous workflows.
- **Exception Handling**: `CompletableFuture` provides mechanisms for handling exceptions that occur during the execution of asynchronous tasks.
- **Completion Callbacks**: You can register callbacks that will be executed when a `CompletableFuture` completes, allowing you to perform further actions or process the result.
- **Combining Results**: `CompletableFuture` provides methods for combining the results of multiple `CompletableFuture` instances, such as `thenCombine`, `thenAcceptBoth`, and more.
- **Timeouts and Cancellation**: You can set timeouts on `CompletableFuture` instances to handle scenarios where an operation takes too long. Additionally, you can cancel a `CompletableFuture` to abort its execution.

## Usage Examples
1. **Basic CompletableFuture Chain**:
   ```java
   CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> performTask())
       .thenApply(result -> processResult(result))
       .thenAccept(finalResult -> handleFinalResult(finalResult));
   ```
   In this example, a `CompletableFuture` is created using `supplyAsync()` with a supplier function that performs a task asynchronously. The subsequent `thenApply()` and `thenAccept()` methods are chained to process and handle the intermediate and final results.

2. **Exception Handling**:
   ```java
   CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> performTask())
       .thenApply(result -> processResult(result))
       .exceptionally(exception -> handleException(exception))
       .thenAccept(finalResult -> handleFinalResult(finalResult));
   ```
   Exception handling is achieved by using the `exceptionally()` method. It allows you to provide a fallback value or handle the exception in case an exception occurs during the execution of the `CompletableFuture` chain.

3. **Combining Multiple CompletableFutures**:
   ```java
   CompletableFuture<Integer> future1 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> performTask1());
   CompletableFuture<String> future2 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> performTask2());
   
   CompletableFuture<String> combinedFuture = future1.thenCombine(future2, (result1, result2) -> combineResults(result1, result2));
   ```
   The `thenCombine()` method allows you to combine the results of two `CompletableFuture` instances into a new `CompletableFuture` by applying a function to the results.

## Conclusion
Java's `CompletableFuture` class provides a rich set of features for writing asynchronous code. It enables you to express complex asynchronous workflows, handle exceptions, and combine results from multiple asynchronous operations. By leveraging `CompletableFuture`, you can achieve efficient, non-blocking, and concurrent programming in Java.
